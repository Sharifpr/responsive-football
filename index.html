                <h2>TOURNAMENT LATEST NEWS</h2>
                <p>The 2022 FIFA World Cup is scheduled to be the 22nd running of the FIFA World Cup competition, the
                    quadrennial international men's football championship contested by the national teams of the member
                    associations of FIFA. It is scheduled to take place in Qatar from 21 November to 18 December 2022.
                    This will be the first World Cup ever to be held in the Arab world.This will be the second World Cup
                    held entirely in Asia after the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan. In addition, the
                    tournament will be the last to involve 32 teams, with an increase to 48 teams scheduled for the 2026
                    tournament in the United States, Mexico, and Canada. The reigning World Cup champions are France.Due
                    to Qatar's intense summer heat, this World Cup will be held from late-November to mid-December,
                    making it the first tournament not to be held in May, June, or July; it is to be played in a reduced
                    timeframe of around 28 days.
                    Accusations of corruption have been made relating to how Qatar won the right to host the event. A
                    FIFA internal investigation and report cleared Qatar of any wrongdoing, but chief investigator
                    Michael J. Garcia has since described FIFA's report on his enquiry as containing "numerous
                    materially incomplete and erroneous representations." On 27 May 2015, Swiss federal prosecutors
                    opened an investigation into corruption and money laundering related to the 2018 and 2022 World Cup
                    bids.On 6 August 2018, former FIFA president Sepp Blatter claimed that Qatar had used "black ops",
                    suggesting that the bid committee had cheated to win the hosting rights.Additionally, Qatar has
                    faced strong criticism due to the treatment of foreign workers involved in preparation for the World
                    Cup, with Amnesty International referring to "forced labour" and stating that hundreds or thousands
                    of migrant workers have died as a result of human rights abuses, and careless and inhumane work
                    conditions, despite worker welfare standards being drafted in 2014.
